- title: Teatro El Circulo
  content: A beautiful, historic theater located inside the city where the wedding will be held. You can buy tickets to get a personalized 
    tour, but be aware that the tour guide only speaks Spanish! There is a hidden gem in the basement--an art gallery of a Rosario native. 
    Some major Phantom of the Opera vibes. https://www.teatro-elcirculo.org/

- title: Restaurants!
  content: Rosario, and Argentina in general, is full of wonderful restaraunts! In most cases, you can eat a three course meal for less 
    than $3 USD. Some of our favourites(:) Davis (https://www.complejodavis.com/), Gimme Shelter House, Rock & Feller's 
    (https://www.rockandfellers.com.ar/)
  
- title: Ice Cream!!
  content: Speaking of food, and good food... ice cream!! You can't leave Rosario without trying some. Seriously. We reccommend (:) 
    Bocha, Touche Creme
  
- title: Orono
  content: Gillian's favourite street in Argentina. Super pretty at night.
  
- title: El Rivero
  content: The river in Rosario is disgusting. It's like the chocolate river in Willy Wonka, except its not chocolate. Lichi promises 
    there's no poop, but Gillian's not so sure. Despite this, it's beautiful to walk along. There are so many fun restaurants and buildings 
    to look at!
  
- title: Mercado del Patio
  content: Cute little market- great place to get souvenirs/gifts from Argentina. There's a lovely little restaurant called Churrasquito
    inside.
  
- title: The Beach!
  content: You can take a ferry (La Fluvial) from Rosario to a little island in the middle of the river and spend a day in the sun! Just 
    be sure to pack sunscreen and a swimsuit you don't care about... remember what I said about the brown water? Yeah. It stained
    my favourite swimsuit.
  
- title: 4 D Theater
  content: The movie will probably be in Spanish, but the experience is totally worth it.
  
- title: Temaiken Zoo
  content: Super neat, humongous zoo just outside of Buenos Aires. https://www.temaiken.org.ar/

- title: Recoleta Cemetery
  content: AMAZING cemetery in Buenos Aires. Think New Orleans. Full of masoleums and cool history. Google maps says its temporarily closed 
    right now, so check before you plan to go! Hopefully things will open back up closer to the wedding. Fun fact- Lichi almost proposed in
    a cemetery (it was supposed to have the best view of the sunrise).

- title: Wine Tasting
  content: The land of Malbec, baby. This one's a plane ride away from Rosario, but definitely worth it. Gillian might even skip her honeymoon 
    to go with you. https://www.earthtrekkers.com/mendoza-wine-region-how-to-plan-visit/

- title: Iguazu Falls
  content: This is also quite a hike from Rosario... they're on the border between Rosario and Brazil, but its the largest waterfall in 
    the world (much bigger than Niagara), and looks absolutely stunning in photographs. And hey, if you make it there, might as well
    check out Brazil, too. :)
