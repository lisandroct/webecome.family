    title: When should I book my flight?
    content: For Argentina, we recommend waiting. As of right now, no foreigners are allowed into the country. Obviously, our hope is that in a year that will change. But, to be safe, wait a bit for that one. For Vegas, book away!"

    title: What's the difference between the Argentina/Vegas weddings? Which one should I go to? 
    content: |
      You are more than welcome to come to both celebrations. However, we understand that it's been a tough year financially, and Argentina is a looong flight. Hopefully this will help you know what to expect for both celebrations and make your decision accordingly. :)
      
      In Argentina, there will be a big, traditional wedding in a church, with a night of celebration to follow--dinner, open bar, dancing, etc. Vegas will be a more casual, laid back celebration. We'll be tying the knot (civilly) on the strip, and celebrating after with a big brunch.
