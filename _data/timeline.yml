    In troubled and gray times, Marta was pregnant and the world was sad. Then Lisandro was born and the universe never was the same again.

    At least that's how he remembers the story.

    A few months before Gillian was born, Lichi was starting elementary school. Before the era of digital photography, Marta paid for a nice picture of her kid smiling in class. This is what she got.

    Okay... that's a lie. It's not that he didn't learn anything, for example, we can see him here at a very productive Economy class where he learnt how to create a bubble inception successfuly.
    
    Teachers, he's very sorry.
    
    That's another lie.

    You know what they say: opposites attract! Gillian was
    ever the shy, studious girl, spending hours studying
    and thinking an A- was the end of the world. Despite
    a few worlds ending, she made it to graduation and
    went on to study computer science at DePauw, inevitably
    leading her to an internship where she would meet Lichi!

    Like the picture says... first day of 13th grade!
    Gillian started her bachelor's degree in 2017 at
    DePauw University. There, she made a lot of wonderful
    friends, learned she loved HIIT workouts, and discovered
    computer science... all which lead her to an internship
    at Stanford, where she met Prince Charming.

    The first time they laid eyes on each other was when 
    Gillian was trying to lug three heavy bags, and Lichi
    offered to help. It was love at first sight for 
    Gillian. For Lichi? Well, he doesn't remember this 
    happening.

  title: Off nights at Stanford

    They worked on the same team that summer, so they spent
    a lot of time together. On their off nights, 
    you'd often find them playing cards together or walking
    around campus. When Lichi finally made the first move,
    Gillian said "This is a bad idea. Long distance relationships
    are hard." Lichi said "Its worth trying." And they kissed.

    They started dating the last week Gillian was at camp, 
    then she was off to school, and he was headed back to
    Argentina. The beginning of their relationship was
    spent video calling and texting--staying up till 2am 
    talking because it was all they could do.

    Happy airport reunion 1! Gillian got a passport and
    hopped on a plane to visit Lichi in Argentina.
    She'd never been out of the country before, nor did
    she speak Spanish, so it was quite the experience. 
    She threw up on the airport tarmac because she was so 
    nervous and excited. Lisandro still kissed her. #keeper

    Empanadas, Espanol, Asado, traveler's diarrhea... our first

    Half a year later, they happily reunited at camp. During the 
    day, they had to pretend that they barely knew each other.
    But, Gillian's class of 4th graders saw her phone background...
    that day at recess they made her a flower crown and started giggling. 
    Then they pulled her over to Lichi to 'marry' them. Cutest wedding
    planners ever.

    Every goodbye was harder than the last. Going from hand holding

    Another long awaited reunion. Lichi came to spend Thanksgiving
    with Gillian's family, braving the cold for her. He loved 
    picking out a live Christmas tree with the family. Then 
    Gillian flew home with him to Argentina for Christmas. She
    sang Christmas carols in Spanish and fell asleep on Christmas 
    (they stay up so late in Tina!). It was a glorious several
    weeks together.

    A year of video calling, sponsored by COVID. So many

    tears, they prevailed!

    Sweet Lichi told Gillian he wanted to take a time
    lapse of the sunrising in Houston. They woke up at
    the crack of dawn, set up a tripod in a park, and
    froze their butts off watching the sunrise. Lichi
    gave Gillian a photo album with 'Will you marry me?'
    hidden in the pages. When she looked up, he was on
    one knee. <3
