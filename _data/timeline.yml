    The first time they laid eyes on each other was when 
    Gillian was trying to lug three heavy bags, and Lichi
    offered to help. It was love at first sight for 
    Gillian. For Lichi? Well, he doesn't remember this 
    happening.

    They worked on the same team that summer, so they spent
    a lot of time together. On their off nights, 
    you'd often find them playing cards together or walking
    around campus. When Lichi finally made the first move,
    Gillian said "This is a bad idea. Long distance relationships
    are hard." Lichi said "Its worth trying." And they kissed.

    They started dating the last week Gillian was at camp, 
    then she was off to school, and he was headed back to
    Argentina. The beginning of their relationship was
    spent video calling and texting--staying up till 2am 
    talking because it was all they could do.

    Happy airport reunion 1! Gillian got a passport and
    hopped on a plane to visit Lichi in Argentina.
    She'd never been out of the country before, nor does
    she speak Spanish, so it was quite the experience. 
    She threw up on the airport tarmac because she was so 
    nervous and excited. Lisandro still kissed her. #keeper

    Half a year later, they happily reunited at camp. During the 
    day, they had to pretend that they barely knew each other.
    But, Gillian's class of 4th graders saw her phone background...
    that day at recess they made her a flower crown and started giggling. 
    Then they pulled her over to Lichi to 'marry' them. Cutest wedding
    planners ever.
