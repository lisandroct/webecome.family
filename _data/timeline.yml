    6lbs , 9 ozs, (idk I'm making this up), Gillian was
    born on new years eve, 1998. Needless to say, her
    mom has never had a new year's celebration quite
    like it.

    You know what they say: opposites attract! Gillian was
    ever the shy, studious girl, spending hours studying
    and thinking an A- was the end of the world. Despite
    a few worlds ending, she made it to graduation and
    went on to study computer science at DePauw, inevitably
    leading her to an internship where she would meet Lichi!

    The first time they laid eyes on each other was when 
    Gillian was trying to lug three heavy bags, and Lichi
    offered to help. It was love at first sight for 
    Gillian. For Lichi? Well, he doesn't remember this 
    happening.

    They worked on the same team that summer, so they spent
    a lot of time together. On their off nights, 
    you'd often find them playing cards together or walking
    around campus. When Lichi finally made the first move,
    Gillian said "This is a bad idea. Long distance relationships
    are hard." Lichi said "Its worth trying." And they kissed.

    They started dating the last week Gillian was at camp, 
    then she was off to school, and he was headed back to
    Argentina. The beginning of their relationship was
    spent video calling and texting--staying up till 2am 
    talking because it was all they could do.

    Happy airport reunion 1! Gillian got a passport and
    hopped on a plane to visit Lichi in Argentina.
    She'd never been out of the country before, nor does
    she speak Spanish, so it was quite the experience. 
    She threw up on the airport tarmac because she was so 
    nervous and excited. Lisandro still kissed her. #keeper

    Empanadas, Espanol, Asado, traveler's diarrhea... our first 
    reunion was quite the experience.Lichi was very sweet, showing
    Gillian around his city, introducing her to his friends and 
    family, and translating everything for her.

    Half a year later, they happily reunited at camp. During the 
    day, they had to pretend that they barely knew each other.
    But, Gillian's class of 4th graders saw her phone background...
    that day at recess they made her a flower crown and started giggling. 
    Then they pulled her over to Lichi to 'marry' them. Cutest wedding
    planners ever.

    Every goodbye was harder than the last. Going from hand holding
    to video calling was heartbreaking, but they were good at it--
    they had a lot of experience.

    Another long awaited reunion. Lichi came to spend Thanksgiving
    with Gillian's family, braving the cold for her. He loved 
    picking out a live Christmas tree with the family. Then 
    Gillian flew home with him to Argentina for Christmas. She
    sang Christmas carols in Spanish and fell asleep on Christmas 
    (they stay up so late in Tina!). It was a glorious several
    weeks together.

    A year of video calling, sponsored by COVID. So many
    plans to see each other derailed. So many long nights
    spent calling. So many I miss you texts. But, despite
    bad wifi connections, time differences, and many 
    tears, we prevailed!

    Sweet Lichi told Gillian he wanted to take a time
    lapse of the sunrising in Houston. They woke up at
    the crack of dawn, set up a tripod in a park, and
    froze their butts off watching the sunrise. Lichi
    gave Gillian a photo album with 'Will you marry me?'
    hidden in the pages. When she looked up, he was on
    one knee. <3
