				<h3>Which airport should I fly into in Argentina?</h3>
				<p>The wedding will be in Rosario, so flying into Aeropuerto Internacional de Rosario Islas Malvinas will be most convenient. However, you can also fly into Buenos Aires (Ezeiza), and there are buses you can take to Rosario. It's about a 4 hour bus ride.</p>
